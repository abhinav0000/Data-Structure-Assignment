# ASSIGNMENT 1

1. Space required to store any two-dimensional array is number of rows*number of columns. Assuming array is used to store elements of the following
matrices, implement an efficient way that reduces the space requirement.<Br>
(a) Diagonal Matrix.<Br>
(b) Tri-diagonal Matrix.<Br>
(c) Lower triangular Matrix.<Br>
(d) Upper triangular Matrix.<Br>
(e) Symmetric Matrix<Br><Br>
2. Write a program to implement the following operations on a Sparse Matrix, assuming
the matrix is represented using a triplet.<br>
(a) Transpose of a matrix.<Br>
(b) Addition of two matrices.<br>
(c) Multiplication of two matrices.<br><Br>
3. Write a program to find sum of every row and every column in a two-dimensional
array.<br><br>
4. Write a program to find a saddle point in a two-dimensional array. A saddle point in a
numerical array is a number that is larger than or equal to every number in its column,
and smaller than or equal to every number in its row.

# SINGLY LINKED LIST:-
1. Develop a menu driven program for the following operations of on a Singly Linked List. <br>
(a) Insertion at the beginning.<Br> 
 (b) Insertion at the end.<Br>
 (c) Insertion in between (before or after a node having a specific value, say 'Insert a new Node 35 before/after the Node 30').<br>
 (d) Deletion from the beginning. <Br>
 (e) Deletion from the end.<br>
 (f) Deletion of a specific node, say 'Delete Node 60'). <BR>
 (g) Search for a node and display its position from head.<Br> 
 (h) Display all the node values.<Br>
2. Write a program to count the number of occurrences of a given key in a singly linked list and then delete all the occurrences. For example, if given linked list is 1->2-         >1>2->1->3->1 and given key is 1, then output should be 4. After deletion of all the occurrences of 1, the linked list is 2->2->3. <Br>
3. Write a program to find the middle of a linked list. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-function-to-print-the-middle-of-the-linked-list/ <Br>
4. Write a program to reverse a linked list.
