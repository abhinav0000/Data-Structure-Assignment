# ASSIGNMENT 1

1. Space required to store any two-dimensional array is number of rows*number of columns. Assuming array is used to store elements of the following
matrices, implement an efficient way that reduces the space requirement.<Br>
(a) Diagonal Matrix.<Br>
(b) Tri-diagonal Matrix.<Br>
(c) Lower triangular Matrix.<Br>
(d) Upper triangular Matrix.<Br>
(e) Symmetric Matrix<Br><Br>
2. Write a program to implement the following operations on a Sparse Matrix, assuming
the matrix is represented using a triplet.<br>
(a) Transpose of a matrix.<Br>
(b) Addition of two matrices.<br>
(c) Multiplication of two matrices.<br><Br>
3. Write a program to find sum of every row and every column in a two-dimensional
array.<br><br>
4. Write a program to find a saddle point in a two-dimensional array. A saddle point in a
numerical array is a number that is larger than or equal to every number in its column,
and smaller than or equal to every number in its row.
